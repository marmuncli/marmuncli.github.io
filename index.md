# About

I am a postgraduate student in Biostatistics at UPC-UB. Currently, I am carrying out my Master's Thesis on my research at the University of Cambridge's MRC Biostatistics Unit, where I analyzed genomic data from liquid biopsies to predict cancer progression and personalize treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Previously, I worked at Fundaci√≥n Pasqual Maragall, where I supported Alzheimer's disease research and clinical trials randomization.

My main interests are cancer, clinical trials and statistical analysis. I am passionate about applying analytical sciences to address complex biological and biomedical challenges, and my work is defined by a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge and improving public health through the use of data.

[Here](./assets/files/cv.pdf) is my CV.
